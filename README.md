# learningc
This is a repository I use for creating a C application that I will use to learn C. Starting from very simple and building on from there.

## Why?
Why do I want to learn C? Well, I have written basic C when I was a kid and also while studying for my Bachelor's. I have forgotten the most of it. I want to learn more.

I have mainly programmed in Python, and I want to learn to program closer to the hardware, including memory management and so on. But I don't want to touch C++ (at least for now), it seems so complicated.

## Why not use Rust or some other modern language?
If you really have to ask, go away! Do I need to justify my hobbies?
